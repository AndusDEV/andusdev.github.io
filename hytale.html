        <h1>HYTALE IS SAVED!</h1>
        <p>
            After years of silence, uncertainty, and fear that the project might never see the light of day,<br>
            Hytale has finally been saved - and not by just anyone. Simon, Hypixel owner and original creator of the project,<br>
            stepped in and bought it back from Riot Games, who wanted to shut the entire project down.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            I've been waiting for Hytale ever since the very first announcement trailer.<br>
            Back then, the game felt like the next evolution of sandbox adventures: beautifully stylized worlds,<br>
            deep RPG mechanics, storytelling potential, modding capabilities, and all the creativity that Hypixel is known for.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            Over the years, even with delays and silence, I never stopped believing in the vision behind Hytale.<br>
            Now knowing that Simon has taken control again gives me more hope than ever.<br>
            It feels like the heart of the project has been restored.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            Now I'm waiting for it more than ever - excited, nostalgic, and genuinely inspired.<br>
            If Hytale finally releases under the guidance of its original creator, it might become the game<br>
            I always hoped it would be since that trailer dropped all those years ago.<br>
        </p>

        <p style="font-size: 150%;">
            Welcome back, <font color="lightgreen">Hytale</font>. You survived.
