                Hi. I'm Andus and I'm 15.<br>
                For now I can program mainly in Java, C# (<a href="https://unity.com/" class="link">Unity Engine</a> scripts), some of Python, HTML, CSS, and barely basics of JavaScript.

            <h2 class="small-title">Beginnings:</h2>
            <h2 class="small-desc">
                It all started almost 3 years ago. That's when I started working with Unity Game Engine. 
                Back then I was creating some basic games with assets from the Asset Store. And I can say that they weren't that bad. A little time after Unity, 
                I Discovered programming language that I started learning first. It was Java. I really liked it's simplicity and how easy it was to learn. So I gave up Unity and started working in Eclipse.
                It was a pretty good IDE for me. I've written some simple applications that are not on <a class="link" href="https://github.com/andusdev/">my Github</a>.
                At some point of my life I started to writing basic apps for Android. One of them for example was "AndusMC", An App for my private Minecraft server where players could see Dynmap, 
                Server Status, Stats, etc. After I installed Android Studio I've seen on the loading screen this sentence "Powered by the IntelliJ Platform". As a kid I had to 
                check what is "IntelliJ Platform". And that's how I discovered another IDE "IntelliJ IDEA". I'm still using it today. 
                From then I started using Github and Writing more advanced Apps like MiniBox that sends emails or SkinViewer that cuts the downloaded skin image.
                It is a great adventure to create such things. I'm really proud of what I've done and learned in past 3 years, and now i know everyone can program if they have desire to learn it.

            <h2 class="small-title">Ethical Hacking:</h2>
            <h2 class="small-desc">
                By the end of 2021 I started learning Ethical Hacking. From WiFi passwords to Android Exploits.
                I'm using <a class="link" href="https://www.kali.org/">Kali Linux</a> 2021.4 for it.
                It is a Linux distribution dedicated for Ethical Hacking with a lot of handful tools like <a class="link" href="https://www.metasploit.com/">Metasploit Framework</a>.
                I still want to work as a programmer but this is a great way for me to spend free time.
                Maybe someday I'll make an tutorial for it on <a class="link" href="blog.andus.dev">my Blog</a>.
